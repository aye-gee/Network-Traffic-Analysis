<h2>👨‍💻 Network Traffic Analysis</h2>

## Objective

The purpose of these projects is to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. Its primary focus is to regulate and control network traffic, acting as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Network security fundamentals
- Firewall functionalities and how they operate to protect networks
- Network protocols and how they are handled by firewalls
- Risk assessment

### Tools Used

- Network analysis tool - Wireshark - for capturing and examining network traffic
- Packet filtering tool - Windows Firewall with Advanced Security
